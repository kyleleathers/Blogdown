**About Me**

**Kyle Leathers**
*Graduate Student*

I am a graduate student interested in how environmental stressors and species interactions affect communities. I enjoy exploring new scientific questions and have a broad research background in aquatic ecology. My previous work includes pharmaceutical and pesticide pollutionâ€™s effects on intraguild predation and computational fluid dynamics models that are used to simulate crustacean olfactory search. I am looking forward to investigating the effects of streamflow alteration on community composition and food web dynamics in the Ruhi Lab.
